Error Handling

Check Error Code and Message
----------------------------

If ``throwExceptionOnError()`` is not turned on, then for all requests that are not made successful, ``DataService`` will store the ``error`` object.

The way to retrieve the ``error`` object is by calling ``getLastError()`` function of ``DataService``.

.. code-block:: php

    //Make the API call
    $result = $dataService->Add($theTargetObj);
    $error =  $dataService->getLastError();

By default, ``$dataService->getLastError()`` will return ``FALSE`` for successful API call, so developers can simply use a ``if`` statement to check if the last API request is made successfully:

.. code-block:: php

    //Make the API call
    $result = $dataService->Add($theTargetObj);
    $error =  $dataService->getLastError();
    if($error){
        ...
    }else{
        ....
    }

If the API request failed, you can use ``getHttpStatusCode()`` and ``getResponseBody()`` to get the ``status code`` and ``response message`` of failed requests, this should be able to help you identify the cause of the issue.

.. code-block:: php

    //Make the API call
    $result = $dataService->Add($theTargetObj);
    $error =  $dataService->getLastError();
    if($error){
        echo "The Status code is: " . $error->getHttpStatusCode() . "\n";
        echo "The Response message is: " . $error->getResponseBody() . "\n";
    }else{
        ....
    }

Report an Error to Intuit
